### Time Series Forecasting Project: A Comparative Analysis of SARIMA and Facebook Prophet Models

#### Project Overview:
This project involves time series forecasting using historical sales data. The primary goal is to predict future sales based on past trends and seasonality. Two popular models, **SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** and **Facebook Prophet**, are employed to compare their forecasting capabilities. By evaluating their performance, the project aims to identify the most suitable model for sales forecasting, particularly focusing on error metrics such as **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error).

#### 1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
The sales data used in the project contains time-indexed records of sales over a given period. The following preprocessing steps were applied to ensure the data was ready for modeling:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing or irregular data points were either interpolated or removed, depending on the context.
- **Resampling**: If the data was not uniformly spaced (e.g., daily sales with missing days), the dataset was resampled to ensure regular intervals.
- **Stationarity Check**: For the SARIMA model, it was crucial to check if the time series was stationary. The **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test** was used for this. Non-stationary data was differenced until stationarity was achieved.

#### 2. **SARIMA Model (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**:
SARIMA is a classical time series model that extends ARIMA by adding a seasonal component. It requires careful manual tuning of hyperparameters such as:
- **p, d, q**: Representing the autoregressive order, differencing, and moving average order.
- **P, D, Q, s**: Seasonal terms corresponding to the ARIMA parameters with periodicity `s`.

**Steps in SARIMA Implementation**:
- **Grid Search for Parameters**: A grid search approach was used to identify the best combination of parameters (p, d, q, P, D, Q, s) that minimized the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).
- **Seasonality Handling**: SARIMA is effective at capturing regular, repeating patterns in the sales data. By incorporating seasonal parameters, the model adjusts to cyclical behavior in the data, such as yearly or quarterly trends.
- **Model Evaluation**: After fitting the SARIMA model, the forecast was compared to actual sales data. RMSE was calculated to assess prediction accuracy.

#### 3. **Facebook Prophet**:
Facebook Prophet is a newer time series model designed for business forecasting, particularly in scenarios where the data includes complex seasonality, trends, and special events. Prophet is flexible, easy to use, and automatically handles certain challenges like missing data and outliers.

**Steps in Prophet Implementation**:
- **Automatic Trend and Seasonality Detection**: Unlike SARIMA, Prophet automatically identifies and models both linear/non-linear trends and multiple seasonalities (weekly, yearly).
- **Adding Holidays and Special Events**: Prophet was further enhanced by adding a calendar of holidays, which often influence sales. This capability allowed Prophet to model sudden dips or spikes in sales during specific periods more accurately.
- **Model Evaluation**: The RMSE for Prophet’s predictions was calculated in the same way as for SARIMA, allowing for direct comparison.

#### 4. **Comparison of SARIMA and Prophet**:
The comparison between SARIMA and Facebook Prophet focused on several key differences in model design, flexibility, and performance.

**Key Differences**:
- **Stationarity Requirements**:
  - **SARIMA**: Requires the time series to be stationary or differenced to become stationary. This adds an extra layer of complexity.
  - **Prophet**: Does not require stationarity and can handle data with changing trends and seasonality automatically.
  
- **Handling of Seasonality**:
  - **SARIMA**: Explicitly models seasonality by specifying seasonal parameters. It works well for regular, periodic seasonality but struggles with irregular patterns.
  - **Prophet**: Automatically detects and models seasonality at different frequencies (daily, weekly, yearly) and can even account for changes in seasonal patterns over time.

- **Holiday Effects**:
  - **SARIMA**: Does not account for holiday effects natively, requiring manual intervention by creating external variables to model the impact of holidays or events.
  - **Prophet**: Can explicitly include holiday effects, adjusting predictions around these dates. This gives Prophet an advantage when dealing with real-world data that is affected by holidays and special events.

- **Trend Modeling**:
  - **SARIMA**: Captures trends but assumes that they are linear or fixed over time, making it less adaptable to non-linear or shifting trends.
  - **Prophet**: Can model non-linear trends and automatically detects "changepoints" where the trend shifts, offering more flexibility in dynamic environments.

- **Ease of Use**:
  - **SARIMA**: Requires significant parameter tuning (p, d, q, etc.) and domain knowledge to implement effectively. It also requires stationarity checks and differencing of the data, which adds complexity.
  - **Prophet**: User-friendly and easy to implement, with fewer manual interventions required. This makes it an ideal choice for users without extensive time series expertise.

- **Performance (RMSE)**:
  - In this project, **Prophet** produced a lower RMSE compared to SARIMA. This was likely due to Prophet’s ability to model non-linear trends, account for holidays, and handle irregular seasonality. SARIMA’s higher RMSE indicated that it struggled with capturing the complexities in the sales data, particularly around holiday periods and irregular trends.

#### 5. **Results and Conclusion**:
- **Prophet’s Strengths**: Its flexibility, ease of use, and ability to handle holidays and complex seasonality gave it an edge in accurately forecasting sales data. The lower RMSE demonstrated its superior performance for this type of real-world data.
- **SARIMA’s Strengths**: SARIMA is a strong model for time series that exhibit consistent, regular patterns and when stationarity is a key factor. It is more interpretable and provides fine control over modeling choices, making it ideal for analysts who require deeper insights into the data.

Ultimately, **Facebook Prophet** was found to be the more effective model for this particular sales forecasting task, given its lower error rate and adaptability to the irregularities in the data. However, **SARIMA** remains a valuable tool, especially when working with simpler, stationary time series where seasonality is consistent.

This project highlights the importance of selecting the right model based on the characteristics of the data and the forecasting requirements.
